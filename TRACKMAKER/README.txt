Hello From Alex!!


NoteMaker.py is a python PyGame built GUI system that builds the tracks to the game. 


How it works:

- Load an .Mp3 file

-Press "Play Song"

- You will press or hold keys 1 2 3 4 to the beat of the song as it is playing to create the custom tracks manually. 

-Then When Your done, click " Save Chart " and this will save a .JSON file that the game is able to be programmed to read.
